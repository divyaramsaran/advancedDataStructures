# Advanced Data Structures in C

## Overview

**Advanced Data Structures** is a comprehensive C language repository designed to showcase implementations, concepts, and applications of both classic and modern data structures. This collection helps you deeply understand, utilize, and experiment with data structures for technical interviews, competitive programming, and systems development.

## Contents

You’ll find well-commented source files, usage examples, and theoretical notes for the following structures:

- **Linear Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular), Stacks, Queues, Deques
- **Hierarchical Structures**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, Heaps (Min/Max), Segment Trees
- **Hashing**: Hash Tables, Collision resolution (chaining, open addressing)
- **Graph Structures**: Adjacency Matrix/List, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms
- **Special Structures**: Trie, Disjoint Set (Union-Find), Priority Queues, LRU Cache (using linked lists and hash table), Skip List
- **Advanced/Applied**: Fenwick/Binary Indexed Tree, Suffix Array, Interval Tree

Each module typically includes:

- Idiomatic C struct-based implementation
- Core functions (insert, delete, search, traverse, etc.)
- Sample main functions for demonstration
- Thorough inline comments
- Time and space complexity notes
